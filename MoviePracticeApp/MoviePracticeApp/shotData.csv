Shot Title, UI Image Name, Description
Establishing, establishing, "An establishing shot is usually the first shot of a new scene used to establish the location and environment. It can also be used to establish mood and give the audience visual clues regarding the time (night/day), year) and the general situation.  This type of shot features the subject far from the camera and as a result we see the area and environment around the subject.  In fact, sometimes the subject can be barely seen."
Wide, wide, "This shot shows a lot of the area and environment around the subject but the subject can be seen.  Wide shots allow the audience to clearly see the subject and the immediate environment and area around them."
