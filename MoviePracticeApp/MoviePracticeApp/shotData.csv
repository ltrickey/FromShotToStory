Establishing,establishing,"An establishing shot is usually the first shot of a new scene used to establish the location and environment. It can also be used to establish mood and give the audience visual clues regarding the time (night/day), year) and the general situation.  This type of shot features the subject far from the camera and as a result we see the area and environment around the subject.  In fact, sometimes the subject can be barely seen."
Wide,wide,"This shot shows a lot of the area and environment around the subject but the subject can be seen.  Wide shots allow the audience to clearly see the subject and the immediate environment and area around them."
Medium,mediumShot,"This shot focuses more on the subject of the take, and we see less of the setting and environment around them.   Medium shots are often used to show a general overview of the subject.  Keep in mind that the look of a medium or wide or close up shot is really dependent on the subject that you are filming or focussing on.  For instance when we are filming a medium shot of a person, you will no longer be able to see the entire body but rather we start to focus on a particular portion of the actor."
Close Up,closeUpShot,"Close-up shots bring the camera in close to the subject and focus squarely on the subject of interest.  Close-Up Fills the screen with part of the subject, such as a person’s head/face. Framed this tightly, the emotions and reaction of a character dominate the scene.  We are no longer showing pieces of the environment or even the rest of the actor's body.  This is where you can generate interest, action, suspense, etc. in your film. Watch any modern day television drama or any recent movie and you will notice how much they use close-up shots."
Extreme Close Up,extremeCloseUpShot,"These shots now take the camera even closer, emphasizing a small area or detail of the subject, such as the eye(s) or mouth.  These are great shots to use for added suspense or to basically draw your audience closer to a specific feature or detail in a shot or scene.  You can have a lot of fun with extreme close-up shots and again play with these shots!"
Over the Shoulder,overTheShoulderShot,"Over-the-Shoulder Shot  A popular shot where a subject is shot from behind the shoulder of another, framing the subject anywhere from a Medium to Close-Up. The shoulder, neck, and/or back of the head of the subject facing away from the camera remains viewable, making the shot useful for showing reactions during conversations. It tends to place more of an emphasis on the connection between two speakers rather than the detachment or isolation that results from single shots."
Point of View,pointOfViewShot,"Point of View Shot (POV) Shot intended to mimic what a particular character in a scene is seeing. This puts the audience directly into the head of the character, letting them experience their emotional state. Common examples are of a character waking up, drifting into unconsciousness, or looking through a scope or binoculars."
Insert,insertShot,"Need to write a description!"
Low,lowAngleShot,"Low angle shots, where the camera points upwards from below, make people (and things) look bigger, more courageous and more important.   These shots are also good for filming people who are looking down at things, so you’re filming their face rather than the top of their head."
High,highAngleShot,"When a subject is photographed from above eye level. This can have the effect of making the subject seem vulnerable, weak, or frightened."
Front,frontAngleShot,"A head-on frontal view makes us feel really engaged with the subject. It’s often used as a subjective shot, where we see the person as if we’re looking through the eyes of another character."
Three Quarter,threeQuarterAngleShot,"With a three-quarter shot we’re a bit less involved."
Profile,profileAngleShot,"In a side view its more as if we’re just watching them as an observer."
