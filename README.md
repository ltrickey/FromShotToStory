## From Shot to Story
An app for [Young Storytellers](https://www.youngstorytellers.com/) participating in the middle school Movie Makers Program to practice filmmaking techniques on the iPad.  Created as Capstone project for [Ada Developer's Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) Cohort 7.

## Problem Statement

Young Storytellers is a Los Angeles Based nonprofit which has a mission to "inspire young people to discover the power of their own voice" through storytelling, playwriting, and filmmaking. 

In one of their core, year-long programs - Movie Makers - highschool aged mentors and industry professionals lead middle school participants through writing and directing their own short films.

The program coordinators have noticed that despite the kids being familiar with the technology used in the program - specifically the cameras on iphones and ipads - the participants lacked the confidence when applying the technology to shoot a narrative film. Although the kids were familiar with selfies and snapchat, when it came to storytelling and evoking emotion through shot choice, they felt unprepared.

I intend to build an iOS app that teaches these kids about traditional filmmaking techniques and how they can be mapped onto the use of an iphone or ipad camera. I hope to build confidence of the participants and lower the technical barriers for these kids to share their stories. This could be used in-class during the weeks where the program mentors are trying to get the kids comfortable with the technical side of filmmaking, or out of class as additional practice.
